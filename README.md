Thanks for checking out our Connect 4 app! This is going to be a basic full stack app where you can play connect 4 with people online, and keep track of wins. It is written in Ruby for the backend, and Angular for the frontend.

Ruby: 3.0.3
Rails: 7.0.3
Angular: 12.2.x

Basic setup:

    After cloning the repo, all you should need to do is run >bundle install in the main folder. For the front end, enter the "/gameFrontEnd" folder and run >npm install (or your preferred JS package manager)

This is still a huge WIP, and currently not functional, but we will update this README along with the project.
